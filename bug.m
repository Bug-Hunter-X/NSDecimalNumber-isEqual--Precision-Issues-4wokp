In Objective-C, a subtle error can occur when dealing with `NSDecimalNumber` objects and comparing them for equality using the `isEqual:` method.  This method performs a precise comparison, which might lead to unexpected results if the numbers have slightly different representations due to floating-point precision issues. For instance, two numbers that appear equal when printed might not be equal according to `isEqual:` because of very small differences in their internal representation.  This can be problematic in financial applications or any situation requiring exact numerical comparison.
